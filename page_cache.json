The system may deny reimbursement or request repayment or payroll deduction if the travel does not comply with these policies:\n- The unit head or delegate must verify the unit has travel funds available and must approve all travel and business meals.\n- All travel must be by the most direct route, using the most economical mode of transportation available considering travel time, costs, and work requirements. If travelers interrupt business travel or deviate from the direct route for personal convenience or personal leave, they will be reimbursed only for uninterrupted travel by the most direct route.\n- The unit head or delegate must approve employee use of private passenger vehicles\u2014if it is the most economical and convenient transportation available. However, travelers who use private passenger vehicles will not be reimbursed for more than the cost of commercial coach round-trip airfare plus transportation to and from the airport.\n- Domestic travel per diem is governed by GSA policy. Travelers do not need to deduct for a complimentary meal provided by a hotel/motel, travel date must be selected for starting and ending day of travel allowing 75% of the per diem rate, and a $5 allowance for incidentals is included in the amount.\n- International travel per diem is governed by the US Department of State. Travelers do not need to select travel days, all meals must be deducted if provided, and incidentals are a percentage of the rate.\n- Expenses must be substantiated by receipts and received by University Payables (UPAY) within 60 days or the entire reimbursement amount may be reported to the employee as processed as taxable income. This 60-day limit is in accordance with IRS guidelines regulations.\n- Lodging charges for official conferences/meetings higher than normally allowed under the lodging allowance are reimbursable if the unit head approves.\nUniversity Payables reports all lodging expenses that exceed the maximum to the Higher Education Travel Control Board (HETCB), except for conferences/official meetings. If HETCB does not allow the exception, the traveler must refund the disallowed amount to the system account charged for lodging.\nProcedure\nTo request reimbursement for domestic or international employee travel and business meals:\n- Be prepared to provide the following:\n- Itemized receipts for non-per diem expenses for $10 or more\n- Translated receipts for international travel\n- For business meals, business purpose of the meeting and business affiliations of the participants\n- Log in to Emburse Enterprise. In the Expenses Ribbon, select Create.\n- In the Document Header screen, enter a report name, business purpose, select TCard and Employee Reimbursements and select the trip type.\n- Proceed through the screens. For international travel, Emburse Enterprise automatically converts foreign currency into U.S. dollars.\n- UPAY will review the request and process for payment. Payees will be notified at their university email address when the payment is deposited to their payroll bank account.\nTravel within Headquarters\nEmployees may incur travel-related expenses within their headquarters while performing their duties, even though they are not in travel status. Common examples include mileage and parking for attending a meeting across campus or to deliver documents. Employees may accumulate these expenses and request reimbursement on a monthly basis by following the steps above.\nEmployees with Approved Accommodations\nTravel using a premium type of transportation may be allowed as part of an approved accommodation. Obtain written authorization from the appropriate university equal employment opportunity (EEO) office or System Human Resource Services for system office employees documenting an approved accommodation prior to purchasing premium transportation. The written authorization must be submitted with the related expense report. Written authorization should specify the duration of the accommodation.\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago\nOffice for Access and Equity\nPhone: (312) 996-8670\nEmail: oae@uic.edu\nUIC Employee Request for Reasonable Accommodation Based on Medical Condition\nUniversity of Illinois at Springfield\nHuman Resources Office\nPhone: (217) 206-6652\nEmail: uishr@uis.edu\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nOffice for Access and Equity\nPhone: (217) 333-0885\nEmail: accessandequity@illinois.edu\nOnline Employee Accommodation Request\nUniversity of Illinois System (System Office Employees)\nSystem Human Resource Services\nPhone: (217) 333-2600\nEmail: lacyjk@uillinois.edu\nReasonable Accommodation Medical Condition Form\nTravel by Employees on Sabbatical Leave\nExpenses related to sabbatical research travel are reimbursable under the IRS accountable plan rules if the research is required by the system and must be performed at the location where the expenses are incurred.

Per diem is not given for same day travel. Per diem supplements the cost of meals. Receipts are not required to receive this per diem allowance. Consult Meal Per Diem Reimbursement for Domestic Travel.\nPer diem is based on the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) rates.\nMeals Provided\nReduce the amount of the per diem you are claiming if you were provided any meals during your travel. For example, if lunch was provided by a conference, subtract the lunch per diem allowance from the total amount you are submitting for reimbursement. If you hosted a business meal do not claim both reimbursement for your meal and per diem allowance. Consult Meal Per Diem Reimbursement for Domestic Travel.\nInternational Travel Reimbursement/Per Diem\nDepending on the internal policies of their unit, international travelers may be reimbursed for lodging expenses using either actual receipts or the U.S. Department of State lodging rates. For meals and incidentals, travelers must use the U.S. Department of State Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) rates.\nWhichever reimbursement method is chosen for lodging must be used for the entire trip.\nActual Receipt Method for Lodging\nWhen traveling internationally employees may pay for lodging using their University T-Card or personal funds. Advantages of using the T-Card include automatic conversion to U.S. dollars at the point of sale and avoiding employee out-of-pocket lodging expense.\nRegardless of the method of payment for lodging, all receipts must be translated into English and submitted as documentation for the expense report. Follow the steps in 8.2.1 Request Reimbursement for Domestic or International Employee Travel and Business Meals.\nU.S. Department of State Per Diem Method\nThe U.S. Department of State foreign per diem rates for lodging are separate from the rates for meals and incidental expenses (M&IE). Per diem for days of departure and return is calculated on the quarter method.\nLodging Rates\nThe maximum lodging amount is intended to substantially cover the cost of lodging at adequate, suitable, and moderately priced facilities.\nMeals and Incidental Expenses (M&IE) Rates\u2014These charges include meals and the following incidentals:\n- Personal use of room and bath during daytime\n- Fees and tips to waiters, porters, baggage handlers, bellhops, hotel servants, dining room stewards, and similar employees\n- Telephone calls to reserve hotel accommodations, make business inquiries such as status of salary, expense vouchers, and advance of funds\n- Laundry, dry cleaning, and pressing of clothing\n- Fans, air conditioning, heating, radio, or television in rooms\n- Transportation between place of lodging or business and places off site to obtain meals, when they are not obtainable within the immediate vicinity\nOther expenses not included in the M&IE rates may be reimbursed using the actual receipt method.\nMeals Provided\nReduce the amount of the M&IE foreign per diem you are claiming if you were provided any meals during your travel, including meals at a conference or on board an airplane, train, or ship:\n- Breakfast\u2014deduct 15%\n- Lunch\u2014deduct 25%\n- Dinner\u2014deduct 40%\nIf you hosted a business meal do not claim both reimbursement for your meal and per diem allowance.
